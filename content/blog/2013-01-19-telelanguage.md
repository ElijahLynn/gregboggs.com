Telelanguage had been working on their website for more than 2 years when I found their call for a Drupal developer. I turned their project around and got their design into a successful Drupal website. Over 5 months, we tweaked, improved, and added features until we had a beautiful, functional, and powerful enterprise website to represent the Telelanguage brand.

The project has many complex features such as:

  1. Custom programmed e-commerce
  2. Specialized, complex AJAX forms
  3. Advanced, custom jQuery affects
  4. Slick  signup and credit card authorization process
  5. Full Drupal integration of all features

I can’t wait to see what the future holds for one of the leading translation companies.
