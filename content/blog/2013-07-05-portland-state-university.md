In a year as a Drupal specialist contractor for Portland State University, I created useful solutions for teachers and students. Working for the PSU gave me the opportunity to delve into the inner workings of Drupal while doing important work.

## The Solutions Journal

My first task was a long list of maintenance tasks for an already completed project. Solutions Journal is an amazingly beautiful academic style magazine. Unfortunately, their ageing Drupal 6 site was overrun by a spammer. This spammer broke every captcha method in the Drupal toolbox, and I tried them all. Eventually, I locked down the spam problem by removing all links from profiles via a formatter, and The journal later blocked profile pages entirely. 

One of my projects was to clone Craig&#8217;s List, which I did quickly using Jobber. However, the project was never used.

## Medieval Portland

This was a fun project converting a custom coded database into a a modern Drupal 7 application. Not only did I have a chance to write my well-used Drupal 7 Drush import script, I got to replicate the pdx.edu theme outside of The main university Drupal. Can you tell the difference? I can&#8217;t.

How do you make a circle created by arrows? We used V&#8217;s and rotated them. It was a pain. But, the results were featured on the PDX.edu/research home page.

## Museum of the City

It&#8217;s a museum in a website. A fantastic project fuelled by student-driven content. Being the most design-oriented programmer at ARC, I was asked to redesign the MotC website. While, I greatly preferred my first design, the end result was pretty great.
