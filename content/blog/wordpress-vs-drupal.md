Dries, the creator of Drupal recently started a conversation about WordPress vs. Drupal that's the first time I've read a [great discussion][1] about the pros and cons of each platform. John Eckman, the founder of one of the best WordPress agencies [responded well][2] on his blog.

John's experiences with the two communities seems similar to my own because I've also been an active participant in both communities. In fact, 3 years ago, I considered myself a WordPress expert. Over the past 3 years, I've become a Drupal expert. Unlike John, I work for a [leading Drupal agency][3] which certainly affects my usage of the two platforms. I know I can build anything in WP. But, there are pros to each platform that leads me to choosing one or the other for specific projects.

# Pros for WordPress

* 1 click upgrades. This feature dramatically reduces the cost of ownership and my boredom.
* Blazing fast performance. WordPress is amazingly fast.
* Commercial module support. The premium model for WordPress drives a lot of revenue for their ecosystem.
* Monolithic, Microsoft-like project structure. I can predict your WordPress database without even seeing it.
* Comment spam protection.
* The Loop. The WordPress loop makes it very easy to do certain things fast.
* Out of the box editor experience that's the same on every site.
* Easy to use Drag and Drop widget system for sidebar blocks.

# Pros for Drupal

* Massive contributed module community. It's not uncommon for 300 different module developers to have code in one of my Drupal builds.
* Advanced search experiences with Solr.
* Editorial multistate workflow moderation.
* Group based permissions on content where users can create, moderate, and join their own groups.
* Data modeling and list creation is straight forward and expected.
* Responsive design support including completely adaptive AJAX driven pages.
* Easy issue queue support with a patch management workflow. If it's broken, I can snag the fix on D.O.
* Modular permissions and caching for logged in users in Core.
