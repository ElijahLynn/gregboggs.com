Dries, the creator of Drupal recently started a conversation about WordPress vs. Drupal that's the first time I've read a [great discussion][1] about the pros and cons of each platform. John Eckman, the founder of one of the best WordPress agencies [responded well][2] on his blog.

John's experiences with the two communities is seems similar to my own because I've also been an active participant in both communities. In fact, 3 years ago, I considered myself a WordPress expert. Over the past 3 years, I've become a Drupal expert. Unlike John, I find myself turning towards Drupal. I know I can build almost anything in WP. But, there are pros to each platform that leads me to choosing one over the other for specific projects.

Pros of WordPress and Drupal

Here are my pros for WordPress for complex, enterprise websites:
1. 1 click upgrades. This feature dramatically reduces the cost of ownership and my boredom.
2. Blazing fast performance. WordPress is amazingly fast.
3. Commercial module support. The premium model for WordPress drives a lot of revenue for their ecosystem.
4. Monolithic, Microsoft-like project structure. I can predict your WordPress database without even seeing it.
5. Comment spam protection.
6. The Loop. The WordPress loop makes it very easy to do certain things fast.
7. Out of the box editor experience that's the same on every site.
8. Easy to use Drag and Drop widget system for sidebar blocks.

Here are my pros for Drupal:
1. Massive contributed module community. It's not uncommon for 300 different module developers to have code in one of my Drupal builds.
2. Advanced search experiences with Solr.
3. Editorial multistate workflow moderation.
4. Group based permissions on content where users can create, moderate, and join their own groups.
5. Data modeling and list creation is straight forward and expected.
6. Responsive design support including completely adaptive AJAX driven pages.
7. Easy issue queue support with a patch management workflow. If it's broken, I can snag the fix on D.O.
8. Modular permissions and caching for logged in users in Core.
