[Living Room Conversations][1] is an amazing project that brings together people from all sides to discuss major political issues. The project was created by [Amanda Kathryn Roman][2] and Joan Blades, the co-founder of [MoveOn.org][3]. While the site is fairly small, I had a blast working with the team, and I got to implement my [user generated content][4] recipe on a live project.

## Kudos from Craig

Shortly after launch Craig Newmark featured LRC on his [CraigConnects blog][5]. Living Room Convserations is one my faviorate projects.
