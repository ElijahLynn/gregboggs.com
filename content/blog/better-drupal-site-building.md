Drupal Global Training Days [is coming up](https://assoc.drupal.org/global-training-day-portland-oregon-february-2016) on February 6th, and this will be the third time I've given an introduction to Drupal 8 for site builders. I spend the day simplifying Drupal for new developers. But once you're beyond the basics of the interface, there are many different ways to accomplish a task in Drupal and Drupal 8 only adds to the choices. So, if you're a Drupal developer looking to craft easier to maintain Drupal 8 sites, this series is for you.

Over the years I've developed many strong opinions about the best way to "drupal". Some of my decisions aren't actually better than alternatives, but they are patterns I've memorized to make my work more efficient so I can avoid getting stuck building sites. This series will cover the following topics: 

* [Drupal Development Best Practices](/drupal-development-best-practices/)
* [Drupal Configuration Workflow](/drupal-configuration-best-practices/)
* [Drupal Breadcrumbs](/drupal8-breadcrumbs/)
* [Theming best practices](/drupal-8-theming-best-practices/)
* Editor Experience basics
* Content modeling in Drupal
* What to do with blocks
* Creating lists correctly
* Mistake-free site search
* Breadcrumbs in 20 minutes
* Permissions and roles basics
* Caching - don't get this wrong
* JavaScript - required for every developer
* CSS - because we can't make white and black websites every time
* Images - no one likes a slow website
* What you know about web fonts is wrong
* Responsive, adaptive sites in Drupal
* Coding standards
* Git usage for Drupal projects
* Cookies are dead
* Deploying Drupal 8
* Performance basics because performance helps the environment
* Web hosting because $5/mo isn't enough

And, if you don't want to wait for me to write and publish all these best practices, feel free to [join me in this Gist](https://gist.github.com/Greg-Boggs/8a2661b70c4e293db585) for a sneak preview without the explanations.
