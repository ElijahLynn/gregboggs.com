IVF1Match.com is a social networking site for egg recipients and egg donors. The site is custom programmed from scratch in the PHP language. The site not only allows recipients to browse profiles and select donors, it implements moderated email messaging between users, useful profile searching, and a robust sign up form that saves donor data as the form progresses so that no one loses their work while filling out complex medical history questions.
