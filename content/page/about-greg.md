Greg has been working with technology since the late 90′s, and he has been a founding partner in two “all hands on deck”
 startup companies. Coming to web development in 2003 after 4 years as a systems administrator, he has over <strong>10 years 
 of professional experience.</strong>
 
With a <strong>master’s degree</strong> in Information Technology and Management from Illinois Institute of Technology 
where he studied both management&nbsp; and <strong>cutting-edge programming</strong> techniques, Greg brings a deep education 
to his professional projects.

Greg has developed <strong>a passion for search engine optimization</strong> and marketing because a great website is a disappointment 
if no one finds it. Leveraging search engines to drive free traffic to your website is the future of Internet marketing, and Greg 
thrives on producing results.
