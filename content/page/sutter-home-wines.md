Sutter Home Wines is a leading wine seller in the United States, and they needed a **fully adaptive and responsive** 
website<!--more--> to communicate their new brand. The New Group delivered a beautiful design in their first responsive site. As my
first project at the agency, and 3rd large responsive project, I helped bring the design to life. By using javascript 
techniques to create an experience that not only responds to screen size, but adapts dynamically, I allowed the designers to 
push the limits of Responsive Design. Knowing the importance of performance on brand perception, I carefully optimized the 
front-end experience.Shortly after launch, the site was **featured on Food Network**, and the site stayed fast under an unexpected 
avalanche of traffic.
 
Key features:

  * Ultra-fast page loads on every device 
  * Javascript powered Adaptive design
  * 10,000 recipe database backed by Apache Solr
