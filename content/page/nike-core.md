Nike Manager Core is a **fully responsive** learning management system that integrates Drupal with Moodle to provide in-store training<!--more-->for Nike managers through smart phones, tablets and desktops. Further, the platform is scalable through **Moodle
integration** to allow it to grow to become a platform that could be used globally for all of Nike's training needs. Nike 
engaged The New Group to maintain consistency in training and management best practices. As **the technical architect** of 
the project, I lead the implementation many complex features such as:

  * Large-scale supporting tens of thousands of users
  * Moodle integration for course status tracking and reporting
  * User generated journal and feedback system to increase engagement and assessment
  * 3 second page load despite each page being unique per user

See the future of training at Nike:
