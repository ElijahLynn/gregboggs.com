Nike Manager Core is a **fully responsive** learning management system that integrates Drupal with Moodle to provide in-store
training<!--more-->for Nike managers through smart phones, tablets and desktops. As a global platform, Core is translated into
**21 languages** with English fallback support. Further, the platform is scalable through **Moodle integration** to allow it to
grow to become a platform that could be used globally for all of Nike's training needs. Nike engaged The New Group to
maintain consistency in training and management best practices. As **the technical architect** of the project, I lead
the implementation many complex features such as:

  * Large-scale supporting tens of thousands of users
  * Moodle integration for course status tracking and reporting
  * User generated journal and feedback system to increase engagement and assessment
  * 21 language multilingual website
