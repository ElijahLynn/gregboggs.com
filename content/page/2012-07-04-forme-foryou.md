Every so often I get the chance to work with amazingly talented professionals. In 2012, I had the challenge of modifying a WordPress theme for an extremely talented designer, Kate Miss. Kate&#8217;s designs are clean and beautiful which made her theme a pleasure to work on.

<img class="size-full wp-image-634 alignright" alt="For me, For you logo" src="http://www.gregboggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/forme-foryou-header-2012.gif" width="250" height="250" />

My goal on the project was to accuriately represent her design while keeping my code out of the way. I had an especially difficult time overlaying the text on top of the border treatment. But, the affect was worth the effort. I&#8217;m grateful I had the chance to work on such a great blog.
