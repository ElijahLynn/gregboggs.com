John Robbins is a best-selling author, social activist, and humanitarian. His work, &#8220;Diet for a New America&#8221; is one of the seminal works on the value of a plant-based diet.

Volunteering my time for John was a truly rewarding experience. As a best-selling author, his website attracts large numbers of links from national news papers, leading websites, and social networks. I took a design originally created by The Spider, a design firm in San Francisco, and turned it into a powerful Word Press template that allows John and his son Ocean editorial control over every aspect of their website.

> Greg Boggs coordinated a team to create a striking design and supplied us with all the tools to manage our own website. His work has included a beautiful WordPress design, custom site programming, search engine optimization, social media consulting, and comments monitoring. Our email list has been building for 10 years, and in the 3 months since our site launch, Greg has supported us in expanding our list by 20%. Also only 3 months after site launch, Greg has helped us to generate more than 5,000 unique visitors in just one day, and to generate more than 4,963 external links promoting our site. Greg is patient, persistent, and brilliant — he has my utmost recommendation.

Along with creating their new website and blog, I&#8217;ve worked closely with the Robbins family to market the new site, providing advice, encouragement, link building, and social networking. On August 5th John&#8217;s hard work blogging on The Huffington Post paid off big time, as his post, The Dark Side of Vitaminwater, went viral on Digg.com and Reddit.com simultaneously!

In two days, his article was read by 600,000 people and shared more than 40,000 times on Twitter and Facebook.
