Hitachi High Technologies is a diverse company with 8 divisions sharing a single Drupal website.<!--more--> While the existing website met their product and organization needs,
The global Hitachi team was having difficulty routing leads from the website to the correct person. So, as **lead developer**, I implemented
user tracking and marketing intelligence throughout the site. I tied this tracking information to the **Salesforce API** where it's recorded
and Salesforce can handle routing the leads to the correct person. Lastly, content was placed behind **spam protected user registration** to
encourage user's to supply contact information for key white papers.

Key feautures:

  * Salesforce integration for lead tracking
  * Marketing intelligence for personalized follow up
  * Gated content to encourage user registration
