Hitachi High Technologies is a diverse company with 8 divisions sharing a Drupal website. I tied user tracking information to 
the **Salesforce API**<!--more--> where Salesforce handles routing the leads.  While the existing website met their product and organization needs,
The global Hitachi team was having difficulty routing leads from the website to the correct person. So, as **lead developer**, I implemented 
marketing intelligence throughout the site. Lastly, content was placed behind **spam protected user registration** to encourage 
user's to supply contact information for key white papers.

Key features:

  * Salesforce integration for lead tracking
  * Marketing intelligence for personalized follow up
  * Gated content to encourage user registration
