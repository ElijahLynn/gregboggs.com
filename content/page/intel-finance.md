Intel stakeholders reached out on LinkedIn to have me build the new Intel Finance website because of my previous experience
building knowledge management tools for Intel HR. Finance takes advantage of all the great features I built for HR, including
powerful filterable search, content subscriptions, and effortless single sign on. Finance takes the tool to the next level by
incorporating private, secure content.

Key features:

  * Powerful Solr search
  * Content subscription system
  * Fully customized editor interface
  * Private content groups backed by organic groups
